# Deploying Sotto

One command brings up a complete hosted instance: Postgres, the sync server, and Caddy serving
the web app with automatic HTTPS. By default it pulls prebuilt multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) images
from GHCR, so the host never compiles anything — a 1 GB free-tier VM with Docker and ports 80/443
open is enough.

```text
internet ──▶ caddy (80/443, web app + API reverse proxy)
                 │ internal network only
                 ├──▶ server (axum, ciphertext-only API)
                 └──▶ ─┘ postgres (named volume)
```

The web app and API share **one origin** (`https://<SOTTO_DOMAIN>`), so the session cookie and
CSP stay same-origin and no CORS is involved. The server stores only ciphertext plus minimal
metadata — see [THREAT-MODEL.md](../THREAT-MODEL.md) — so the box hosts nothing that can decrypt
your secrets; still, treat it as production infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

1. **A host** with Docker + Docker Compose, ports 80 and 443 reachable from the internet.
2. **DNS**: an A (and/or AAAA) record for your domain pointing at the host. Caddy provisions the
   TLS certificate automatically once the name resolves.
3. **A GitHub OAuth app** (github.com → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New) with
   the authorization callback URL set to exactly:

   ```text
   https://<your-domain>/auth/github/callback
   ```

## First deployment

```sh
git clone https://github.com/getsotto/sotto.git && cd sotto/deploy
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env        # domain, a generated Postgres password, OAuth client id + secret

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Database migrations run automatically on server boot. Pin a released version with
`SOTTO_IMAGE_TAG=vX.Y.Z` in `.env` (default: `latest`). To build everything from source instead —
for unreleased changes, or if you'd rather not trust prebuilt images — use
`up -d --build`; that needs ~4 GB of RAM and takes several minutes the first time.

On a 1 GB host, give the kernel some headroom before the first start:

```sh
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

Smoke test:

```sh
curl -fsS https://<your-domain>/health    # → ok
```

Then open `https://<your-domain>` in a browser and sign in with GitHub. Point the CLI at your
instance with `sotto login --server https://<your-domain>`.

## Upgrading

```sh
git pull    # picks up compose/runbook changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Migrations are forward-only and applied on boot. Check the release notes for anything flagged as
a compatibility break before upgrading past a minor version.

## Backups

Postgres holds only ciphertext and metadata, but losing it loses your users' synced vaults:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec postgres \
  pg_dump -U sotto sotto > "sotto-$(date +%F).sql"
```

Restore into a fresh instance with `psql -U sotto sotto < backup.sql` (via `exec -T postgres`).
Run the dump on a cron schedule and ship it off the box.

## Billing (optional)

The server ships with Stripe billing dark: without the `STRIPE_*` variables, billing endpoints
return 503 and orgs are tiered manually. To turn it on:

1. In the Stripe dashboard: create a Product with one monthly Price (the flat per-org Team
   subscription) and note the `price_…` id.
2. Add a webhook endpoint for `https://<SOTTO_DOMAIN>/billing/webhook` subscribed to
   `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and
   `customer.subscription.deleted`; note its `whsec_…` signing secret.
3. Fill `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` in `.env`, then
   `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --force-recreate server`.

Card data never touches the server — checkout and subscription management happen on
Stripe-hosted pages, and the webhook only assigns the org's tier.

## Operations

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f server   # API logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f caddy    # access/TLS logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps               # health at a glance
```

- Postgres is **not** exposed outside the compose network; only Caddy publishes ports.
- Certificates and Caddy state persist in the `caddy_data` volume; database data in `pgdata`.
- The API route list lives in the repo-root [`Caddyfile`](../Caddyfile) (baked into the web
  image at build time) — pulling the matching image version picks up route changes automatically.
- To try it without a public domain, set `SOTTO_DOMAIN=localhost`: Caddy serves a self-signed
  certificate (`curl -k https://localhost/health`). GitHub login still requires a callback URL
  reachable by your browser.
